	/**
	 * <code>View</code> is the abstract base class for any view classes. You can use
	 * views to organize the display hierarchy in a Tetragon-based game or application.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * A view is a display object container that can hold any number of other AS3 display
	 * objects (sprites, movieclips, shapes, bitmaps, etc.) and/or other <code>View</code>
	 * objects as it's display children. The top level views in the Tetragon display
	 * hirarchy must always be <code>View</code> subclasses that are children in a
	 * <code>Screen</code> subclass. These <code>View</code> subclasses in turn can
	 * contain other <code>View</code> subclasses and AS3 native display objects.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * View children that are subclassing the <code>View</code> class can be registered in
	 * their parent view class inside the <code>registerChildren()</code> method. When the
	 * parent view is started, updated, reset, stopped, disposed, enabled/disabled or
	 * paused/unpaused, all it's registered view children follow along and have their
	 * respective methods automatically called in the order they were registered.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Native AS3 display objects that are added to a view as children or
	 * <code>View</code> subclasses that are not registered in their parent view need to
	 * be manually started, updated, stopped, disposed, etc. in case they require any of
	 * these functionalities. For this any of the respective methods in the parent view
	 * class can be overriden, their super method called and any additional instructions
	 * added.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * View classes always follow a stricty defined order of execution. <b>The constructor of
	 * a <code>View</code> subclass is never overriden.</b> They are instantiated
	 * automatically by their parent view class (or by their parent screen class if they
	 * are top level views). When a view class is created, several of it's methods are
	 * called automatically in the following order:
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>The view is instantiated and it's constructor is executed.</li>
	 * <li>The <code>setup()</code> method is called.<br/>
	 * Then after the view's parent view or screen is ready, the following method are
	 * called:</li>
	 * <li>The <code>createChildren()</code> method is called.</li>
	 * <li>The <code>registerChildren()</code> method is called.</li>
	 * <li>The <code>addChildren()</code> method is called.</li>
	 * <li>The <code>addListeners()</code> method is called.</li>
	 * <li>The <code>executeBeforeStart()</code> method is called.</li>
	 * <li>The view executes step 3, 4, 5 and 6 on all it's registered child views.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * 
	 * <p>For views that should not be registered as a child view in their parent view or
	 * screen and that can be instantiated at a later time, extend the
	 * <code>DeferredView</code> class instead.</p>
	 * 
	 * @see Screen
