	/** A class that provides constant values for visual blend mode effects. 
	 *   
	 *  <p>A blend mode is always defined by two 'Context3DBlendFactor' values. A blend factor 
	 *  represents a particular four-value vector that is multiplied with the source or destination
	 *  color in the blending formula. The blending formula is:</p>
	 * 
	 *  <pre>result = source × sourceFactor + destination × destinationFactor</pre>
	 * 
	 *  <p>In the formula, the source color is the output color of the pixel shader program. The 
	 *  destination color is the color that currently exists in the color buffer, as set by 
	 *  previous clear and draw operations.</p>
	 *  
	 *  <p>Beware that blending factors produce different output depending on the texture type.
	 *  Textures may contain 'premultiplied alpha' (pma), which means that their RGB values were 
	 *  multiplied with their color value (to save processing time). Textures based on 'BitmapData'
	 *  objects have premultiplied alpha values, while ATF textures haven't. For this reason, 
	 *  a blending mode may have different factors depending on the pma value.</p>
	 *
